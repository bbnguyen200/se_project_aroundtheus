**Intro**

Welcome to my project! This project was built from a layout found in Figma, where page dimensions were provided. Additionally, any graphics were exported directly from that Figma design. The purpose behind this work was to build a website landing page that is able to be viewed on different device resolutions. Depending on whether the page is being viewed on a cellphone, tablet, or computer, the grid cards will change in their orientation from a 3x2 layout on a computer, to a 2x3 layout on a tablet, and a 1x6 layout on a cellular device. This was all achieved with a combination of flex box containers, with flex grid and media queries to adjust the page layout based on resolution. All code was written with Visual Studio Code, and uploaded via GitHub.
